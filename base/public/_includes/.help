                                                                            Creating a file!:
at this stage it is necessary to know which type of file you will create if it is of the `module` or `custom` type,
remember the `custom` is necessary a verification to identify the created file and after the identification of the file it will be implemented in all as user-accessed pages.
Unlike `module` it basically consists of being callable in a file called `call` with which you can call any file without identifying anything inside the `module` folder.

For you create a `module` file you need create a file in the directory: content/require
For you call a `module` file you need create a variable to call he like this: "{% include call file="[TheFileName]" anothervariable="[Cool]" %}" (it works for any page including include files.)
Configuring Custom Variables 

For you create a `custom` file you need create a file in the directory: content/custom
For you call a `custom` file its not required the `custom` files its enabled automatic but you need confirm shes like this: follow the step "Confirm to CALL"

                           Confirm to CALL:
after you created the file in content/custom
goto the file _data/include/files_confirmation.yml and put the new file and descripiton
Exemple:


files_confirmated:
  - name: "page_empty"
    desc: "If the Page stay Empty the user goto a error page 204"
  - name: "My_New_File"
    desc: "Cool anti cheat"

The descripition its not require
