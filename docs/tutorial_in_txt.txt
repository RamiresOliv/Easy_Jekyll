well lets start with simple?

    for starts good use {{ site.title }} non in this div!
    the "site" its like get infos by the file "_config.yml" like descripition, title, github_username and others
    the "page" its like get infos by the current page! for test use {{ page.name }}

    others like "remove" in the exemple: {{ page.name }} gona return "After.md" but using the tag remove {{ page.name | remove: '.md' }} gona return only "After" you can do so muth codes with this xd

    let me explain aout the ifs and others like that for you use ifs its really easy use: {% if instance == true %} if is true {% else %} if is not true {% endif %} super easy to use

    ATTENTION!: you know ruby?
